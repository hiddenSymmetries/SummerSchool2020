    "In this lab, we will show how to use analytical derivatives to optimize coils.  First, we will introduce how coils are represented and parameterized.  Next, we will define quadratic penalty functions that depend on the geometry and position of the coils. We will also compute the analytical derivative of each penalty function with respect to the design parameters of the coils.  After constructing the objective function, we will compute its gradient analytically.  Finally, we will use a quasi-Newton method (the BFGS algorithm) to find optimal coils according to our objective function."
